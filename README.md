# tree-visualizer
A Java application that visualizes Binary Search Tree structures and their operations for educational purposes. 

Frontend built with JavaFX, dependencies managed with Maven.
___
### Features
* Currently supports **Binary Search Trees** (BSTs) and **AVL** trees, with future support planned for **Red-Black** trees
* Visual rendering of insert, delete, and search operations
* Visualize tree traversals algorithms: **in-order, pre-order, and post-order traversals**
* Zoom and pan navigation using mouse scroll and drag
